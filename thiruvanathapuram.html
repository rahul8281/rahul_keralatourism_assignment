                  <div class="panel-body">Built in the 1840s by the great Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, the Kuthira Malika Palace stands as an iconic monument that gives you a curious insight into the glorious history of Kerala. 'Kuthira Malika' literally translates to 'Mansion of horses', and it has been named so because of the 122 horses that adorn the many pillars that support the southern roof of this majestic structure. The main idea behind building this palace was to preserve and promote the many traditional art forms of India, mainly the south.

                    Take a patient stroll along this palace with one of the local guides, and you will be enthralled by the mystical charm of this magnanimous palace. Right in the premises of this palace, you will also come across the infamous Kuthira Malika Museum which is indeed a haven for history buffs and those who appreciate the beauty of prehistoric antiquities. The museum houses artifacts like the ethnic jewelry that was once worn by the queens, wooden paintings and carvings, armory and idols made of the purest metal. Another fascinating reason for this palace's popularity is the Swathi Sangeethotsavam, an annual music festival that is conducted right in palace premises! Thousands of people throng here to watch the mesmerizing performances of the many leading classical musicians that are invited to this festival.</div>

                  <div class="panel-body">The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple in Trivandrum is one of the most talked about temples of not just the south, but the entire country. Among the many reasons for its popularity, probably the most eye-catching one is that it received a Guinness World Book record when over 37 lakh women offered pongala at this temple at once, making it the destination of the largest gathering of women for a religious activity! Popularly known as the 'Sabarimala of Women', this temple draws a massive throng of women each year during the famous Attukal Pongala festival. Rich in cultural heritage and adorned by impeccable Tamil architecture, this temple holds an extremely critical place in the hearts of the natives and the devotees of Goddess Bhagavathy, the principal deity of this temple.

                    Visiting the grand temple and praying to Attukal Devi has been attested by many as a life-changing experience. They say that the goddess blesses her devotees with progeny, heath, wealth and in all, a bountiful life. The temple's Attukal Pongala Festival is a huge hit in the south, and its celebration is eagerly awaited by the locals. Tourists and devotees from far and wide come to Trivandrumespeciallyy during the festival period to witness its joyous and colourful celebration</div>
