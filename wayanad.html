          <p>Major attraction and one of the scenic Wayanad tourist places is Meenmutty Waterfalls located at a distance of around 29 kilometers from Kalpetta. It is a famous waterfall in the state of Kerala. A three tiered waterfall is a surprising sight to be visited.

            The waterfalls fall down from a height of 300 meters. To reach the waterfalls, you can do a trekking for about 2 kilometers through the thick jungles from the Wayanad-Ooty Road. It becomes very dangerous during monsoon and rainy seasons. The gushing waterfalls are located near the Neyyar Reservoir area.
            
            People with an adrenaline rush come here in plenty to experience the different levels of rock climbing and trekking. The location exhibits an ideal blend of stunning natural sights with amazing trekking trails in Wayanad. Banasurasagar Dam is the closest attraction which gives the waterfalls fame among the adventure lovers.
